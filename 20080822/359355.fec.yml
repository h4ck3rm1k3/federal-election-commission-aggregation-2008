    of July 25, 2008, reference the June Monthly Report:  Item 1 - the OCE Financial
    Services offset of $17,800 was to cover the expense of terminating our lease agreement
    with Ikon for our Copier equipment and initiating a new lease for newer equipment
    with OCE.  A payment of $16,454.17 was made to Ikon on 5/19/2008, a final monthly
    lease payment of $997.77 was made to Ikon on 4/17/2008, and a payment for transporting
    the old copier back to Ikon was made to Specialized Transportation on 6/19/2008
    for $683.71.  These payments total $18,135.65 which is slightly above the amount
    we received from OCE which was an estimated payoff amount.  The Southwest Publishing
    offset of $2115.98 was for an overcharge of payment made on 10/19/2007 for invoice
    of $6146.63.  Item 2 - The ratio reported for NOVA-Barbour should have been revised
