    balance of 17445.32 has been forgiven) BMW Direct was hired as the fundraising
    counsel to the committee for the purpose of developing and implementing a national
    direct mail fundraising program. The initial phase was to develop a donor file
    through costly propsect mailings followed by housefile mailings to cover the cost
    of prospecting and provide the campaign with net dollars. All invoices related
    to the mailings were to be paid from the escrow account with funds raised through
    the mailings. In the summer of 2006, the committee's opponent, a controversial
    congresswoman who had made national headlines through her scandalous behavior,
    was defeated in the Primary. This event destroyed the results of the mailing program.
    From that point on, BMW efforts were directed toward raising the money necessary
    to paying off the debts incurred in the prospecting program. BMW Direct continued
    to mail the committee's donors until it reached a point at which it could no longer
    guarantee that the mailings would bring in net dollars. At that point, BMW informed
    the committee that it could not continue to mail and the committee informed BMW
    that it had no money with which to pay its invoices."
