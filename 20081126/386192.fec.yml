    letter about our October Quarterly report, FEC-368728, we submit the following:
    1) In Schedule A, two PACs had incorrect aggregate values in the ECTD field.  This
    was due to contributors being entered into our database more than once.  Although
    all entries contained the correct FEC identification numbe,r our software did
    not properly aggragate the totals.  This has been corrected by identifying duplicate
    records and consolidating entries.  All contributions were properly reported originally
    and this did not result in an underreporting of contributions or in the acceptance
    of excessive contributions.  2) Two $1,000 PAC contributions were received on
    August 11, 2008.  The required 48 hour notice was filed on 08/11/08 in FEC-356544
    and these contributions were subsequently reported in the October Quarterly Report,
    FEC-368728.  This has been verbally confirmed by FEC staff.  3)  In Schedule B,
    disbursements were reported to credit card companies some of which included payments
    to original vendors who received in excess of $200 in the election cycle.  These
    original vendors have now been itemized in memo entries.  4)  In Schedule B, disbursements
    were reported to individuals as reimbursements for campaign expenses.   Several
    of these were for paymenst to an original vendor who received an aggregate in
    excess of $200 during the election cycle.  This original vendor has now been itemized
    in memo entries."
