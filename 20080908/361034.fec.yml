    Matt Shaner to his campaign Citizens for Matt Shaner on 04/18/2008 was not submitted
    for a 48 hour report, because the contribution was under the $10,000.00 filing

    had been filing on time since the candidate Matt Shaner was required to do so.
    \ Now that the FEC has informed Citizens for Matt Shaner that we are required
    to file the 48 hour reports for the candidate before the election.  We will be
    vigilant in our efforts to ensure that all future reports are filled on time."
